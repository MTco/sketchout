SketchOut
=========
Using the Android Location Service and an automated back-end Python script, SketchOut creates a heatmap based on the most recent crime data of the users' geographic vicinity. SketchOut sends an automated warning when the users enter an unsafe area, and calls for a Uber ride so that the user can safely exit from the dangerous areas.
